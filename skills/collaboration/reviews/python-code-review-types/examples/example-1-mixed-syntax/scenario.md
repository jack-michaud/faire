# Scenario: Mixed Old and New Typing Syntax

A developer has partially migrated code to Python 3.12+ but mixed old `typing` module syntax with new built-in generic syntax. This creates inconsistency and confusion.

**Difficulty**: Medium
**Common in**: Codebases undergoing gradual migration from Python 3.9/3.10 to 3.12+
