# Example 3: Legitimate Test Infrastructure

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Description**: Files that look like test artifacts but are actually critical test infrastructure components.

**Test Goals**:
- Avoid false positives on legitimate test infrastructure
- Correctly identify that test snapshots are referenced
- Understand test result documentation when it's part of CI/CD
- Distinguish between temp files and generated test assets

**Expected Outcome**: Skill should approve all files as legitimate test infrastructure, demonstrating nuanced understanding of test ecosystem.
